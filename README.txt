This project is a Android app game engine library. It is meant to be used as a starting point for two dimensional games. 

This library is based on the open source game Replica Island, the code for that game can be found here: http://code.google.com/p/replicaisland/
	Classes originally from this project still have their license headers, although most classes have been modified in some way.


Features:
-App life cycle management
-Render and Game thread management
-Two dimensional image drawing, including coloring and rotations.
